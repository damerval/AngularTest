    <h4>History of New York City</h4>
    <p>The Dutch first settled along the Hudson River in 1624; two years later they established the colony
      of New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. In 1664, the English took control of the area and renamed it New York.
      One of the original 13 colonies, New York played a crucial political and strategic role during the American
      Revolution. Between 1892 and 1954, millions of immigrants arrived in New York Harbor and passed through
      Ellis Island on their journey to becoming U.S citizens. It is estimated that up to 40 percent of Americans
      can trace at least one ancestor to that port of entry. New York City, the largest city in the state,
      is home to the New York Stock Exchange and is a major international economic center.</p>

  <div class="panel" ng-show="isSelected(2)">
    <h4>History of San Francisco</h4>
    <p>Perched atop hills and filled-in marshland at the entrance to one of the Pacificâ€™s largest natural harbors,
      San Francisco has had an oversized influence on the history of California and the United States.
      Originally a Spanish (later Mexican) mission and pueblo, it was conquered by the United States in 1846 and
      by an invading army of prospectors following the 1848 discovery of gold in its hinterland. The Gold Rush
      made San Francisco a cosmopolitan metropolis with a frontier edge. The great 1906 earthquake and fire
      destroyed much of the city but barely slowed its momentum; San Francisco barreled through the 20th century
      as a center of wealth, military power, progressive culture and high technology.</p>

  <div class="panel" ng-show="isSelected(3)">
    <h4>History of Honolulu</h4>
    <p>Aptly named "The Gathering Place," Oahu is the hub of the Hawaiian Islands, and Honolulu is the heartbeat of Oahu.
      Most of Honolulu is settled in a narrow shoulder on the south shore of Oahu, nestled between mountains
      and the Pacific Ocean, and surrounded by fields of sugarcane and pineapple, ranch lands, and farms.
      One of the most ethnically diverse cities in the United States, more than 75 percent of the state's
      multicultural population reside there. The economic and entertainment capital of Hawaii, Honolulu
      is a sophisticated metropolis with a plethora of activities, attractions, and events; however,
      the city also enjoys a tropical atmosphere and magnificent natural beauty. Much of Hawaii's culture
      is preserved in Honolulu, in its many museums, churches, national memorials and monuments, and the Iolani Palace,
      the only royal palace in the United States. Perhaps all of these are reasons why 70,000 travelers
      from around the world visit the island each day.</p>
